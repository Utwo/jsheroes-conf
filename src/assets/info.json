The intersection of health and animation with biofeedback sensors, the future of 3d in the browser complete with interviews with people who are writing these specs... this talk will show that in terms of animation on the web, we're just getting started.",

However, recent developments in tooling make it more and more accessible for developers and people with little or no experience.\n\nOne of these advancements is the ability to now train and run machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, opening this world to front-end developers to learn and experiment.\n\nIn this presentation, we will talk about the different applications, possibilities, tools and resources, as well as show a few examples and demos, so you can get started building your own experiments using machine learning in JavaScript.",

    "description": "Done well, open source is one of the highest-value targets for businesses these days. Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies — and even if they _do_ open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch — because they're missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.\n\nProjects that survive in today's landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source _and_ the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including:\n\n    Offering open pair programming hours\n    Trusting _all_ contributors with merge access\n    Sending free swag to contributors\n    And much more!\n\nLearn how you can borrow our strategies to create a healthy, welcoming community for your open source projects, starting today!",

Soon you may find yourself responsible for a critical piece of the internet and are really excited.\n\nLater you realize you have no idea who is using it, find it hard to communicate to your users, are burdened with the ever -increasing workload, and desperate to find help. You discover that it's hard to let go or trust anyone else. Should you just make more tools? How do we even begin to start solving this problem?\n\nThis talk will go into my experience of working on open source full time for the last year and the many issues faced: whether it's the burden of work, the issues of freedom, fundraising difficulties, and on top of that emotional well being. Let's talk about working to support maintainers personally, consistently, and in community.\n",

Mental health issues can be much harder to detect in yourself and others, but is essential that our community focuses on improving how we talk about and respond to them.\n\nIn this talk, I will share some personal experiences and lessons I've learnt about mental health, and suggest steps anybody can take to support those facing mental health issues.

Keeping a coherent mental model of it is even harder.\n\nFinite State Machines seem to offer a good abstraction of the way we interact with UIs, making states and transitions between them explicit, and thus easier to reason about.\n\nOne of the nice things about FSMs is that only certain transitions are legal from each state. But is it possible to enforce that in code? It seems that, with some TypeScript magic, it is possible.\n\nIn this talk, you'll be exposed to a new perspective on implementing FSMs in JS/TS and how it compares to libraries such as XState or Redux (not really a FSM, but similar). You'll also see how this new approach can be used in real apps, using various libraries, such as React, Vue, and others, some of them quite unexpected.",

A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, or event loop, in order to process messages. Each kind of message has an associated function which handles it, and both Node.js and Chromium, which Electron embeds, have different event loops which must be reconciled. This talk will discuss the principles of the event loop as well as the challenges and solutions that Electron faced and arrived at in order to make the synthesis of Node.js and Chromium in Electron possible.

In fact, most of the JavaScript that`s around these days seems to either be written for, or within, a JavaScript flavor like React, Vue, or Angular. Frameworks make writing your own code faster and more ergonomic, but they do not come without problems. Code written with Framework A depends on the environment Framework A provides in order to work — and this dependency often represents a lot of code to transmit, decompress, parse, and compile. What about \"plain\" JavaScript? Is it always naïve to think anything worthwhile can still be achieved just writing some straight-up code? It turns out this is a tricky question to answer, but there`s no doubt the little we do as JavaScripters is often done with much more than we need.",

    "description": "Developers are quick to complain about \"JavaScript Fatigue\", the perceived high volatility of libraries, tooling and the JavaScript language itself — yet very few look at these changes and additions as a whole. In this talk I will take some of JavaScript's new features with the biggest transformative potential (ES Modules, WebAssembly, the DOM-Node.js API convergence), and I try to showcase what they mean for web development and how, when used together, they are able to address various hurdles and complaints that have been plaguing Node.js & web development for a long time.",
